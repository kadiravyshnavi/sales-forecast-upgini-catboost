Baseline vs Upgini feature-enriched CatBoost model for sales forecasting
# Sales Forecasting with CatBoost & Upgini

## Overview
This project compares a baseline CatBoost model with an Upgini-enriched
CatBoost model for time-series sales forecasting.

## Notebooks
- `01_baseline_model.ipynb` – Baseline CatBoost model
- `02_upgini_model.ipynb` – CatBoost with Upgini feature enrichment
- `03_baseline_vs_upgini.ipynb` – Model comparison using SMAPE

## Dataset
Daily store–item sales data.

## Metric
SMAPE (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error)

## Result
Upgini feature enrichment improves forecasting accuracy compared
to the baseline model.
